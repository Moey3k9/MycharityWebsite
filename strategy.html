    Extreme poverty won't end until we all come together and help everyone, everywhere to have clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene.
      What's at the heart of our strategy? Making water, toilets and hygiene normal for everyone, everywhere as these are basic human rights.

  <p style='background-color:white; font-size:15px; width:300px;height:450px;float:right;'>
At UKAid were determined make that a reality within a generation and we as a team believe that the best way to make this possible is by working closely with others.<br>
UKAid is part of an active global network who works closely with campaigners, fundraisers, engineers and advisors.
<br> Everyone at UKAid is all working towards the same goal which is to get water for the less fortunate who donâ€™t have access to clean water and getting toilets and hygiene to the millions of people around the world suffering without these basic human rights
By all coming and working together we can enable entire communities to have these basic human rights and help them break free from poverty and change their lives for ever.
