# MycharityWebsite
A website promoting WaterAid for the less fortunate, my first year project
This is a project I completed in my first year of university for a module called Building For the web. This module was very exciting and challenging as it was my first coding experiences, Overall, I felt passionate about the topic I chosen as there are many people in the world struggling without any clean water and my aim was to bring some awareness for the cause.
