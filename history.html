      Our journey began back in the 1980s and as we started it was a group of only 5 of us and we had an idea, our idea was to help people in any way possible so we all sat down and brought our ideas together.<br>
      Within time we managed to come to an understanding of the fundamentals believes of how to give support to the less fortunate thus we agreed to give them aid by supplying them with necessities and sanitation as these are the basic human rights.
      <h4 style='background-color:white; font-size:20px; width:300px;height:350px;float:right;'>We began an awareness campaign called UkAid to help spread our ideology faster and to make people aware of real life crisis. Through many struggles and complications, we managed to achieve our goal of reaching 30 countries within 30 years.</h4>
